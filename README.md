# Threatify

  ## Introduction
  Threatify aims to provide a new mode of surveillance. It aims to shift from manual surveillance to Deep Learning based surveillance where a model is responsible for identifying and classifying threat from a CCTV feed.


  ## Dataset
  The dataset that we are using is **[UCF-Crime Dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/projects/real-world/)**. This is a video dataset containing CCTV videos. It has a total of 14 classes i.e. Abuse, Arrest, Arson, Assault, Burglary, etc. including Normal Event too. The classes that we are focusing on are:
  1. Fighting
  2. Gun-Event
  3. Arson & Explosion
  4. Normal Event
